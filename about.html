            <h2>About The Maker's Gallery</h2>
            <p>
                The Maker's Gallery is a professional online hub for individuals in the McMaster School of Visual Art and Design(<a href="https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/visual_art_and_design/>SVAD</a>) at the University of South Carolina to showcase their creative work across disciplines. Our mission is to connect student artists with real-world opportunities and foster local community engagement with emerging creatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                The platform features student profiles, portfolios, and projects in video production, design, animation, game design, and studio arts. We aim to provide visibility, networking, and inspiration for both students and the broader arts community. The Maker's Gallery allows us to point to a singular location for members of the Columbia, SC community to find creatives for their projects, and launches creatives as freelancers and local artists.
